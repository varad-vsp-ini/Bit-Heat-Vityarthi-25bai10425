# Bit-Heat-Vityarthi-25bai10425
Bit Heat: For a given base of logic system, it takes in number of inputs and outputs along with the respective truth table and computes the minimum landauer's heat per erased bit for that particular logic gate. Moreoever this program also allows user to simulate a specific logic operation and calculate minimum Landauer heat for specific logic optn
